      <div className='text-cont'>
        <p className={` slide-in txt-1 bottom-slide-in`}>Hello there! I&apos;m Adeyemi Oluwagbenga Daniel, a passionate front-end developer and creative graphic designer with a love for crafting digital experiences that blend aesthetics and functionality. With two years of experience, I&apos;ve honed my skills and expertise to bring visions to life on the web.</p>
        <h3>Designing Experiences, One Pixel at a Time</h3>
        <p className='txt-1 slide-in bottom-slide-in'>From a young age, I&apos;ve been captivated by the world of design and technology. This fascination led me to pursue a career that seamlessly merges these two passions. As a graphic designer, I have an eye for detail and a knack for translating ideas into visually appealing designs. Each project is a canvas where I blend colors, typography, and layout to create a visual language that resonates with users.</p>
        <h3>Bringing Designs to Life through Front-End Development</h3>
        <p className='txt-1 slide-in bottom-slide-in'>Design is only half the story. My journey in front-end development began with the desire to bridge the gap between design and functionality. Armed with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Typescript. I specialize in turning static designs into interactive and responsive websites. The challenge of creating user-friendly interfaces that not only look stunning but also offer seamless navigation drives my work.</p>
